# TSD Environment Matching

All statistical analyses can be found in the 3 R scripts:
 1. "Reaction Norm Estimation.R" = script to estimate Bayesian posteriors of sex-ratio reaction norms for each turtle population.
 2. "Climate Data Extraction.R" = script to extract 3 air temperature variables from each population location. Uses data on nesting and incubation periods in "nesting.csv" as well as climate rasters listed in the "CHELSA*" text files.
 3. "PMMs.R" = script to fit (multi-response) phylogenetic mixed models for estimating phylogenetic heritabilities and (partial) trait correlations.

"Thomson.nwk" is the time-calibrated phylogeny of Thomson et al. (2021, PNAS) with species names edited to match the ROSIE database and tips edited to include species with sex-ratio data as described in the manuscript.
